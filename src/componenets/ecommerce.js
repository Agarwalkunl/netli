                The design and functionality of your eCommerce website design
                could make or break conversions and affect your bottom line. An
                eCommerce site has several layers of functionality that arenâ€™t
                on standard websites, including a web server to host a
                storefront, payment processing, an inventory database and a
                complicated dispatch system used to send products.

                      It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the
                      appropriate classes that we use to style each element.
                      These classes control the overall appearance, as well as
                      the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify
                      any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default
                      variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML
                      can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the
                      transition does limit overflow.
