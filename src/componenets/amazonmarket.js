                      It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the
                      appropriate classes that we use to style each element.
                      These classes control the overall appearance, as well as
                      the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify
                      any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default
                      variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML
                      can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the
                      transition does limit overflow.
