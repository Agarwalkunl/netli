                eCommerce has significantly changed the business scenario.
                Today, Shopify powers over a million businesses worldwide. This
                proves that eCommerce marketing is not just one strategy among
                many -- it is a global business necessity.
                <br />
                Shopify is considered among the leading eCommerce solutions and
                innovations that continue to redefine the global marketplace. In
                the last six months alone, Shopify generated over 46.45 million
                visits and received approximately 218 million orders in the
                previous year.
                <br />
                This all-in-one eCommerce platform now has more than 2 million
                active users, which contribute more than $183 billion in global
                economic activity. Overall, Shopify holds an impressive 31
                percent of the eCommerce market.

                In WordPress terms, themes decide your websiteâ€™s look and feel
                while plugins add functionality, such as adding a contact form
                or installing search engine optimization (SEO) tools. Generally,
                a WordPress web designer focuses on your branding and visual
                elements while a WordPress web developer deals with the code.
                <br />
                The possibilities are endless with a WordPress website, but you
                need a professional WordPress design and development team to
                make your vision come to life.
