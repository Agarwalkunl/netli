                <b>What is Technical SEO and Why is it Important?</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                Technical SEO is the process of ensuring your website is
                compatible with search engine guidelines so that it can be
                crawled and indexed without any problems. The main goal of a
                technical SEO audit is to assess your website’s current SEO and
                determine which aspects you need to improve for a seamless
                online experience.
                <br />
                Over the years, user demands have dramatically changed and
                search engines have become more sophisticated. According to
                Statista, there are now approximately 3.5 billion smartphone
                users across the globe. This massive surge in smartphone usage
                has prompted Google to launch an algorithm update that places
                more importance on site speed and mobile experience in ranking
                web pages.
                <br />
                Today, websites with a poor structure, slow page load time and
                wonky redirects can be penalized by Google. Without proper
                intervention, these technical SEO issues may result in a steep
                drop in search rankings and organic traffic. Given that the top
                organic search results receive nearly 35 percent of clicks, a
                decline in ranking could be detrimental for your business.

                At the core of algorithm changes is one goal: to provide the
                best user experience possible. To achieve this, you need to
                understand carefully what is technical SEO, what it entails and
                how you can leverage SEO technical audit to ensure your website
                adheres to search engine guidelines and industry standards.
                <br />
                Technical on page SEO includes several components, such as site
                speed, Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), robots exclusion standard
                (robots.txt), XML sitemap status and content quality. These
                factors are critical to your website’s online performance.
                According to Google, a 10-second page load speed can result in a
                123 percent increase in bounce rate. A one-second delay in
                mobile page loading time can lead to a 20 percent drop in
                conversion rate, an 11 percent decline in page views and a 16
                percent decrease in customer satisfaction.
