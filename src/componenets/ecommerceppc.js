                eCommerce SEO <br />
                With the introduction of the internet and technological
                advancements, consumer needs are fast-changing. Customers now
                prefer the quickest and easiest ways to purchase what they need
                while maintaining a busy lifestyle. In fact, research shows that
                an estimated 1.8 billion people worldwide purchase goods through
                eCommerce services.
                <br />
                Online shopping provides the convenience that traditional stores
                can only hope to match. This means eCommerce SEO services are
                quickly becoming a necessity for many retailers and
                business-to-business (B2B) companies.

              <p>
                In WordPress terms, themes decide your website’s look and feel
                while plugins add functionality, such as adding a contact form
                or installing search engine optimization (SEO) tools. Generally,
                a WordPress web designer focuses on your branding and visual
                elements while a WordPress web developer deals with the code.
                <br />
                The possibilities are endless with a WordPress website, but you
                need a professional WordPress design and development team to
                make your vision come to life.

                Boost Your Brand Visibility and Improve Customer Experience
              </p>
              <p>
                eCommerce online marketing is growing at an unprecedented rate.
                With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and
                machine-learning technologies, online sellers deal with
                increased demand for improved customer experience.
                <br />
                Consumers want immediate personal service. Not only do they
                expect a seamless post-purchase experience, but they also want a
                personalized brand encounter throughout their online buying
                journey. As such, eCommerce digital marketing strategies built
                around large subsets of data must shift toward more specific
                audience segments.
                <br />
                According to research from Boston Consulting Group (BCG),
                personalized online campaigns can lift sales by as much as 10
                percent. However, only 15 percent of companies utilize eCommerce
                content marketing to its fullest extent. By optimizing your
                product pages and leveraging behavioral data, you can create a
                personalized user experience on your eCommerce site.
                <br />
                Another challenge that online sellers face is the lack of
                understanding of how search algorithms work. eCommerce companies
                depend on search engines for traffic. Without a solid eCommerce
                marketing strategy in place, your online store will be buried at
                the bottom of the search engine results pages (SERPs).
                <br />
                Rank high on search results and deliver a more enjoyable
                customer experience with the help of Thrive!
