              <p>
                Creating a digital presence doesn’t mean simply building a
                website and waiting for customers to approach your brand. Your
                website is your company’s online foundation. It serves as your
                primary customer touchpoint and conversion machine. As such, you
                must ensure it ranks high in search engines, stands out from the
                competition and relates to your visitors' intentions.
              </p>

            <div className="col-lg-6">

                Statistics reveal that website design and navigation influence
                94 percent of first impressions. Search engines also favor
                websites with responsive web design and well-structured web
                content. What’s more, 75 percent of site credibility comes from
                web page design.
                <br />
                As a business owner, it is critical that you maintain a
                responsive website design to appeal to search engines and online
                users. You must ensure your target customers see a legit
                business platform when they search for your company online.
                Otherwise, you risk losing trust from your prospective clients
                and dissuade them from engaging with your brand.
                <br />
                Invest in responsive website design and build trust and
                confidence in your brand offerings. Our web design company
                provides SEO-friendly website design services that aim to boost
                your search rankings, increase your online exposure and convert

                Still on the fence about creating your website or optimizing
                your existing website design? It doesn’t matter if you own a
                startup or a large enterprise, you need responsive website
                design to promote your brand and create a strong digital
                footprint in this competitive marketplace.
                <br />
                Today, several businesses have adopted responsive web design to
                gain more page visitors and maximize their conversion
                opportunities. Despite its growing popularity, however, many
                companies still settle for static web page design. Don’t fall
                behind the competition. Capitalize on personalized web design
                services and deliver the best possible online experience to your
                target customers.

                Studies show that there are approximately 3.5 billion smartphone
                users globally. An eMarketer survey also revealed that adults in
                the U.S. spend an average of 2 hours and 55 minutes on their
                mobile devices every day. With the increasing prevalence of

                design, you can ensure your website responds to customer needs
                and the capabilities of the devices they are using.

                Our years of experience in building websites have taught us that
                to build a superior website for our clients that positions them
                above the competition, we need the following ingredients:

                <b>1. Visual Appeal</b> <br />
                You only have one chance to make a great first impression. Are
                your site visitors saying WOW! or OW!? when they see your site
                for the first time? People make immediate decisions about the
                credibility of your company, brand and products when they see
                your website. As a business owner, you must ensure your web
                design captures your target audience’s attention and entices
                them to explore your website.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>2. Ease of Use</b> <br />
                If your site can't be easily navigated and your valuable content
                can't be easily found, then your users will go elsewhere. Don’t
                let this be the case. At Thrive, we work hard to plan and build
                intuitive, simple and easy to navigate websites. We want our
                users to feel like everything is right where they expect it to
                be.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>3. High-Quality, Optimized Content </b> <br />
                Investing in beautiful website design and neglecting the content
                is like buying a car without an engine. A superior website has
                compelling and concise content with clear CTAs. When you work
                with us, our website design experts work closely with you to
                ensure your site content is well-written, search
                engine-optimized and created with clear business objectives in
                mind.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>4. Conversion of Visitors into Customers</b> <br />
                Early on in the planning process, we determine what a
                "conversion" or CTA looks like for your website. It could be to
                submit a lead form, make a phone call or purchase a product. We
                then keep that goal in mind for the entire process, from design
                and coding to content writing. We want your website to be the
                primary tool for growth in your company.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>5. Traffic Growth Over Time</b> <br />
                At Thrive, we want to see your new website rise to the next
                level. To do that, we need lots of quality traffic. Our
                WordPress web design agency works with you to establish an
                ongoing internet marketing plan that includes SEO, social media
                marketing, email marketing and more.

                      any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default
                      variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML
                      can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the
                      transition does limit overflow.
