                If you’ve performed a Google search on “what is WordPress,” you
                most likely did so after having experienced a WordPress website.
                WordPress is a website creation tool that powers more than 38
                percent of the web — that means approximately 1 in 3 websites
                trust WordPress services. If you searched “how to design a
                WordPress website,” then you’ll find that this platform is
                considered incredibly user-friendly and easy to understand.

              <p>
                We work with Amazon legacy sellers as well who have already been
                using Amazon Enhanced Brand Content. Amazon EBC was introduced
                to sellers in 2016 and became known as Amazon A+ Content in
                2018. Our Amazon experts audit your current Amazon EBC text,
                images and videos and work with you to find ways to improve the
                content. Is your Amazon EBC not leading to more conversions and
                increased sales? Well, why not? We use in-depth analysis and our
                tried-and-true tactics to boost your A+ Content and improve your
                Amazon seller SEO. We make sure your Amazon EBC is up-to-date
                with the latest A+ Content guidelines and requirements for
                branded sellers.

                Also, as part of our Amazon account management, we ensure your
                competitors are following all the rules and not infringing on
                your copyrights by illegally selling your products. Our Amazon
                listing service system monitors and sends automated removal
                requests to ensure Buy Box leech removals. This process can
                escalate to legal action -- if needed -- and our Amazon experts
                have resources to guide you through that process as well. We
                help protect your business and brand against Amazon leech scams.
